This project take part of my **final project**.  I chose this topic because I have always been curious to understand the fundamentals of computer vision. I've always wanted to know how the magic works.

It's been over 3 years since the last commit, and since then I've learned a lot about software development. I'm revisiting this project to **revitalize** it and also to implement new technologies that I'm interested in **learning**.
